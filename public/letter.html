      <h1>For You</h1>

      <div class="letter-box">
        <p class="line">Some memories don’t fade.</p>
        <p class="line">Some people never leave.</p>
        <p class="line">Even when paths change,</p>
        <p class="line">what we felt was real.</p>

        <p class="line">Hey Geeky!</p>

        <p class="line">
          I'm sorry it has turned out to be like this 🙁. I'm really incapable
          of having someone as good as you in my life.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Whatever I did when we were together was real, and I’d hate for you to
          think otherwise.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          You are the best girlfriend there is. I know this hurts, and I’m sorry
          it’s because of me.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          You’ll always be the best person in my life that ever existed. I’ll
          always be there for you — I promise ❤️
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Please don’t slack like I did. I know you’re strong enough to handle
          this, and I truly believe you’ll do great.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          This is my first website. I hope you like it — it took weeks of
          sleepless nights, and it’s only for you.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Talking to my mom after everything is hard. You don’t have to. I just
          want you to be okay.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          No matter where life takes us next, I hope you always remember this —
          you were deeply loved, genuinely appreciated, and never taken for
          granted.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Some connections don’t end, they simply change shape. And this one
          will always mean something to me.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          I hope life gives you everything you deserve — peace, laughter,
          success, and a love that never makes you doubt yourself.
        </p>

        <p class="line">
          Thank you for being a chapter I will always read with a soft smile.
        </p>

        <p class="line">Take care of yourself. Always. 🤍</p>
